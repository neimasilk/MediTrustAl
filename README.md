# MediTrustAl Project

## Project Description

MediTrustAl is a comprehensive platform designed to address various challenges in global and local healthcare services, including in Hangzhou and China. These challenges include data fragmentation, difficulty in leveraging large volumes of clinical narrative data, a lack of sophisticated predictive analytics to support proactive decision-making, and crucial issues related to patient data privacy and security. MediTrustAl synergistically integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain technology.

MediTrustAl's core innovation lies in the unique combination of these three technologies:
* **NLP** to extract meaning and valuable insights from unstructured medical data such as doctor's notes and pathology reports.
* **AI** to provide predictive analytics, personalized care, and clinical decision support.
* **Blockchain** to guarantee security, privacy, data interoperability, and transparent and decentralized governance.

This project aims to improve the quality of healthcare services, operational efficiency for service providers, patient empowerment through greater control over their health data, and accelerate medical research progress.

## Project Goal (Platform Vision)

MediTrustAl aims to create a connected, intelligent, secure, and patient-centric healthcare ecosystem. This vision goes beyond mere data management, towards empowering all stakeholders in the health system through the synergistic utilization of advanced technologies.

## Project Scope (Based on Initial MVP)

The initial focus (Minimum Viable Product - MVP) will cover the development of core platform components and validation of the technical concept, including:
* Development of a basic NLP module for key information extraction from Mandarin-language medical records.
* Development of initial predictive AI models for 1-2 priority use cases relevant to Hangzhou.
* Implementation of a basic blockchain architecture (e.g., private permissioned testnet) for decentralized identity management (DID) and simple access permission mechanisms.
* Development of an initial user interface (UI) for patients and doctors to demonstrate core functionalities.

## Technologies Used

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) / Deep Learning (DL)
* Blockchain (likely a consortium or private permissioned blockchain)
* Interoperability standards like HL7 FHIR.
* Medical ontologies such as SNOMED CT, ICD-10/11, and Chinese medical ontologies (e.g., CDMO).

## Project Structure & Methodology

This project will follow the "Vibe Coding Indonesia V1.0" methodology. All planning and progress documents will be stored in the `memory-bank/` folder.

## How to Get Started (For Developers)

1.  Ensure you have access to all recommended tools in the "Vibe Coding Indonesia V1.0" guide.
2.  Familiarize yourself with all documents within the `memory-bank/` folder:
    * `product-design-document.md`: To understand the vision, features, and target users.
    * `tech-stack.md`: For details on the technologies used.
    * `implementation-plan.md`: For MVP implementation steps.
    * `architecture.md`: To understand the system architecture.
3.  Follow the iterative development cycle described in the "Vibe Coding" guide, starting by reviewing `status-todolist-suggestions.md` and creating `baby-step.md` with the help of a planning AI (e.g., Gemini).

## Contribution

Contribution guidelines will be added in the future. For now, follow the "Vibe Coding" workflow.

## License

The license will be determined later.
