# **MediTrustAl Project Proposal for Implementation in Hangzhou and Competitive Advantages**

## **1. Executive Summary**

Global and local healthcare services, including in Hangzhou and China, face significant challenges such as data fragmentation, difficulty in leveraging large volumes of clinical narrative data, a lack of sophisticated predictive analytics to support proactive decision-making, and crucial issues related to patient data privacy and security. These challenges are becoming more pressing with the increase in healthcare costs, the ever-increasing burden of chronic diseases, and the need for more personalized and targeted care. In Hangzhou, an aging population and increased demand for high-quality healthcare services are additional factors that reinforce this urgency.¹

MediTrustAl is proposed as a comprehensive platform designed to address these various challenges through the synergistic integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain technology. MediTrustAl's core innovation lies in the unique combination of these three technologies: NLP to extract meaning and valuable insights from unstructured medical data such as doctor's notes and pathology reports; AI to provide predictive analytics, personalized care, and clinical decision support; and Blockchain to guarantee security, privacy, data interoperability, and transparent and decentralized governance.¹

This approach is highly aligned with Hangzhou's strategic priorities to become a leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) innovation and healthcare/biomedical services, as well as supporting the development of a digital economy based on responsible data utilization. The opening narrative of the MediTrustAl proposal must immediately link these global and local health problems with Hangzhou's innovation ambitions. By connecting real challenges such as pressure on the health system due to an aging population and the high prevalence of chronic diseases in Zhejiang², and then directly offering MediTrustAl as an innovative solution, the proposal will have a stronger appeal than a mere technical explanation. The Hangzhou Innovation Competition seeks high-impact projects, and MediTrustAl has the potential for that.

The expected impact of MediTrustAl implementation includes improving the quality of healthcare services, operational efficiency for service providers, patient empowerment through greater control over their health data, and accelerating medical research progress. The term "Decentralized Smart Health Ecosystem" used by MediTrustAl needs to be reinforced with a vision of how this platform can become the foundation for the development of other health applications and innovations in Hangzhou. This is in line with the city's desire to become a global technology leader and focus on "future industries." MediTrustAl, if positioned as an ecosystem, not just a single product, will be more attractive due to its potential to stimulate further innovation and support the digital transformation agenda in the health sector.

Through participation in the Hangzhou innovation competition, MediTrustAl seeks strategic funding support, which the competition offers in the range of 1 to 10 million yuan³, partnerships with local health and technology institutions, and support for the implementation and trial of the platform in Hangzhou's dynamic health ecosystem. This proposal will demonstrate how MediTrustAl has transformative potential, in line with the "Radto Focused" spirit promoted by the competition, namely radical and high-impact innovation.

## **2. Background and Problem Statement**

### **Global and Local Healthcare Context**

The healthcare sector globally faces universal challenges that are increasingly complex. Rising healthcare costs are a burden for governments and individuals, while the prevalence of chronic diseases continues to increase, demanding more sustainable and proactive care models. In addition, there is a growing need for more personalized care, tailored to the unique characteristics of each individual, from genetic profiles to lifestyles.

In the context of China and more specifically in Hangzhou and Zhejiang Province, these challenges are amplified by demographic and socio-economic dynamics. A rapidly aging population – data shows that by the end of 2023, 21.1% of China's population was aged 60 and over⁵ – puts additional pressure on the healthcare system. Rapid urbanization and rising living standards drive demand for high-quality and easily accessible healthcare services. The Chinese and regional governments have responded with various health reform and digitalization initiatives, such as the "Healthy China 2030" program⁶ and the implementation of the Integrated County Healthcare Consortium (ICHC) in Zhejiang.⁷ However, primary care in Zhejiang still faces constraints, including a shortage of skilled personnel, perceptions of low-quality care in primary facilities, and significant challenges in information communication and interoperability between health institutions.⁸ Data fragmentation is not only a technical problem but also a major obstacle to the effectiveness of reform initiatives like ICHC. ICHC aims to integrate services and promote a "health-centered" model, but studies show problems in the interconnection of information systems and effective data sharing.⁹

The burden of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, has a high prevalence in Zhejiang Province, especially in the elderly population. Data from 2021 shows that 74.82% of the elderly in Zhejiang suffer from at least one chronic disease, and 36.04% experience multimorbidity.² This condition, coupled with an ever-aging population, significantly increases the urgency for predictive and personalized health solutions capable of proactively managing chronic conditions and preventing complications. Traditional reactive care systems are no longer adequate to address the scale and complexity of these challenges.

### **Specific Problems Addressed by MediTrustAl**

MediTrustAl is designed to address a series of specific problems that hinder the efficiency, quality, and accessibility of healthcare services, both globally and in the context of Hangzhou and China:

* **Data Fragmentation and Silos:** Patient data is often scattered across various unconnected systems (Electronic Health Records/EHR, hospital systems, clinics, laboratories), hindering the creation of a holistic view of a patient's health history. In China, the lack of system integration within hospitals themselves¹¹ and challenges in data sharing between ICHC and public health institutions exacerbate this problem.⁸ This fragmentation complicates care coordination, increases the risk of medical errors, and hampers large-scale data analysis for service improvement.
* **Dominance of Unstructured Data:** Most important clinical information, such as doctor's notes, medical history, narrative examination results, and pathology reports, is stored in free-text or narrative format. This data is rich in contextual information but difficult to analyze systematically using traditional methods, so the potential valuable insights contained within it are often unutilized.
* **Lack of Predictive Analytics and Personalization:** Current healthcare systems tend to be more reactive, treating diseases after they emerge, rather than proactive in predicting risks and performing early interventions. The potential of AI for predictive disease analysis, identification of high-risk patients, and personalization of treatment plans based on individual profiles has not been optimally utilized. This is highly relevant given the high need for chronic disease management² and care for the ever-increasing elderly population.⁴
* **Privacy and Data Security Concerns:** Incidents of medical data breaches and patients' lack of control over their own health data are serious concerns. In China, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) sets strict standards for the collection, use, and protection of personal data, especially health data which is considered sensitive.¹² Compliance with PIPL is not just a challenge, but also an opportunity for MediTrustAl to demonstrate a superior data governance model through blockchain technology, which can be a unique selling proposition (USP) in the Chinese market. Many health systems may struggle to adapt to strict PIPL regulations, especially regarding explicit consent and data transfer.
* **Interoperability Barriers:** Difficulties in sharing data securely and efficiently among different healthcare providers, as well as among diverse information systems, are major obstacles to coordinated and sustainable care. Zhejiang Province itself is promoting the establishment of medical data sharing centers (such as imaging, ECG, pathology, and laboratory data) at the county level to improve interoperability.⁹ Initiatives like "Digital Health Town" in Hangzhou¹⁴ and "City Brain 3.0"¹⁶ demonstrate the readiness of digital infrastructure and an ecosystem that supports solutions like MediTrustAl. However, these initiatives also highlight the need for a platform capable of integrating these various data sources securely, intelligently, and interoperably. MediTrustAl can act as an "intelligence and trust layer" that connects and maximizes the value of existing digital infrastructure.

## **3. Proposed Solution: MediTrustAl**

### **Platform Vision**

MediTrustAl aims to create a connected, intelligent, secure, and patient-centric healthcare ecosystem. This vision goes beyond mere data management, towards empowering all stakeholders in the health system through the synergistic utilization of advanced technologies.

### **General Functionality Description (Clarified with Specific Use Cases for Hangzhou)**

MediTrustAl's functionality is designed to provide tangible benefits to various users within the healthcare ecosystem, with an emphasis on Hangzhou's specific context and needs:

* **Patient Data and Permission Management:**
  * Patients will have full control over their health data, including who can access it, for what purpose, and for how long. This is realized through an intuitive interface and consent mechanisms based on smart contracts on the blockchain. This functionality directly supports and facilitates compliance with China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which emphasizes individual rights over their personal data.¹²
  * *Hangzhou Use Case Example:* An elderly person in Hangzhou with a history of chronic illness can easily grant limited access to their family doctor at the ICHC (Integrated County Healthcare Consortium) for their diabetes-related data, but not for their mental health data, except in emergencies. They can also grant limited anonymous permission for their diabetes data to be used by researchers at Westlake University for epidemiological studies.
* **Access to Relevant Data and Utilization of AI Tools by Doctors and Healthcare Providers:**
  * Doctors and healthcare providers, with patient permission, can access comprehensive and structured patient medical histories, regardless of where the data was originally created. They will also be equipped with AI tools, such as clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and risk prediction models.
  * *Hangzhou Use Case Example:* A doctor at ICHC Deqing, Zhejiang, who treats many elderly patients with multimorbidity², can use MediTrustAl to view a patient's complete treatment history from various previous hospitals. MediTrustAl's AI system can provide early warnings if there is a potential for harmful drug interactions or predict the risk of complications based on the patient's latest data, helping the doctor provide more proactive and safer care. This helps address the doctor's workload and improves the quality of diagnosis for common diseases in the region.
* **Access to Anonymized Data for Research by Medical Researchers:**
  * Medical researchers can submit requests for access to strictly anonymized patient datasets for research purposes, with patient consent and through clear data governance regulated by smart contracts. The anonymization and de-identification process will use advanced NLP techniques to ensure PIPL compliance.
  * *Hangzhou Use Case Example:* Researchers at Zhejiang Lab or Zhejiang University School of Medicine¹⁵ who are developing new AI models for early detection of lung cancer can access anonymized medical image datasets and narrative clinical notes from patients throughout Hangzhou via MediTrustAl, after obtaining ethical approval and appropriate governance. This accelerates biomedical innovation, in line with Hangzhou's ambitions. A "meta-consent" model¹³ can be explored to facilitate patient participation in research while maintaining their control.

This functionality must be depicted through clear user journeys for each stakeholder, demonstrating tangible benefits in the specific context of Hangzhou, thus making the solution more understandable and seemingly implementable.

### **High-Level System Architecture**

MediTrustAl's architecture is designed modularly to ensure security, scalability, and interoperability:

* **Data Layer (Blockchain):**
  * Utilizes blockchain technology (most likely a consortium or private permissioned blockchain, which is more suitable for health data¹⁷) to store hashes (digital fingerprints) of medical records, not the raw data itself. This ensures the integrity and immutability of records without compromising the privacy of raw data.
  * Decentralized Identity Management (DID) for patients, doctors, and institutions, ensuring secure and verifiable digital identities.
  * Smart contracts to manage patient access permissions, data sharing governance, research protocols, and potential incentive mechanisms. This architecture is explicitly designed to support PIPL compliance.¹²
  * The raw medical data itself will be stored off-chain in secure and encrypted data repositories (e.g., on hospital servers or cloud storage that meets Chinese security standards), with encrypted links to the hashes stored on the blockchain. This is a crucial point to allay concerns regarding PIPL and the scalability of storing raw medical data on the blockchain.
* **Processing and Analytics Layer (NLP & AI):**
  * **NLP Module:** Tasked with processing narrative medical data (doctor's notes, pathology reports, etc.). Its main functions include information extraction (medical concepts, relationships between concepts), terminology standardization (mapping to medical ontologies such as SNOMED CT, ICD-10/11, or Chinese medical ontologies like CDMO¹⁹), data de-identification for privacy, and clinical summary generation.¹
  * **AI Module:** Implements various machine learning and deep learning models for predictive analysis (e.g., disease risk prediction, prognosis), development of individual risk models, provision of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) for doctors, and personalization of treatment plans and lifestyle recommendations.¹
* **Application/Interface Layer:**
  * Provides user-friendly portals or applications for various stakeholders:
    * **Patient Portal:** To manage health data, view medical history, set access permissions, and interact with service providers.
    * **Doctor/Clinician Portal:** To access patient data (with permission), use CDSS and AI analytics tools, and collaborate with other specialists.
    * **Researcher Portal:** To submit requests for anonymous data access, manage research projects, and access data analysis tools (with strict governance).
    * **System Administrator Portal:** To manage platform operations, security, and compliance.
* **Simple Architecture Diagram:**
  * A clear visualization will be included to illustrate how these components interact, including main data flows, user interactions, and potential integration with external systems such as Hospital Information Systems (HIS/SIRS), existing EHR systems, or ICHC platforms in Hangzhou. It is important to mention the interoperability standards that will be supported, such as HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)²⁰, to facilitate seamless integration. The use of these standards will enhance technical credibility and demonstrate consideration for practical integration, in line with Zhejiang's efforts to promote medical data sharing.⁹

(A Simple Architecture Diagram will be presented as an image in the actual proposal, showing the interaction between the data layer (blockchain & off-chain storage), processing layer (NLP & AI Engine), and application layer (patient, doctor, researcher portals), as well as data and permission flows).

### **Flagship Use Cases for Hangzhou**

1. **Proactive Management of Chronic Diseases in the Elderly at ICHC:**
   * *Problem:* High prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension in the elderly population in Hangzhou and Zhejiang², and challenges in continuous monitoring and early intervention at the primary care level (ICHC).¹⁰
   * *MediTrustAl Solution:* Elderly patients can integrate data from wearable devices (with permission) and routine visits to the ICHC. MediTrustAl's AI module will analyze this longitudinal data to predict the risk of complications (e.g., hypoglycemic episodes, hypertensive crises), provide warnings to family doctors at the ICHC, and suggest personalized interventions (e.g., dietary adjustments, medication reminders, visit schedules). NLP will help extract important information from doctor consultation notes to enrich the patient profile. Blockchain ensures data is secure and only accessed by authorized parties.
   * *Impact:* Improved quality of life for the elderly, reduction in emergency visits and hospitalizations, and increased efficiency in chronic disease management at the ICHC.
2. **Optimization of Sepsis Diagnosis and Treatment in Referral Hospitals:**
   * *Problem:* Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostic delays can be fatal.
   * *MediTrustAl Solution:* At a referral hospital in Hangzhou (e.g., Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital²³), MediTrustAl can integrate patient data in real-time from various sources (vital signs monitors, lab results, nurse notes). A predictive AI model will continuously monitor sepsis risk. If the risk increases, the system will provide an early warning to the medical team, present a summary of relevant clinical data extracted by NLP, and recommend evidence-based treatment protocols through CDSS. A blockchain audit trail records all actions and data access.
   * *Impact:* Increased rate of early sepsis detection, accelerated medical response, reduced mortality rate due to sepsis, and optimization of hospital resource utilization.

## **4. Key Technology Components and Innovation**

MediTrustAl is built upon three main technology pillars that work synergistically: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain. Innovation lies not only in the sophistication of each component but also in how they are integrated to create a holistic and trusted healthcare solution.

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Understanding Medical Records**

Narrative medical data, such as doctor's notes, pathology reports, and patient histories, contain extremely rich clinical information but are difficult to process systematically. MediTrustAl's NLP module is designed to unlock the potential of this data.

* **Techniques Used:**
  * Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies and classifies key medical entities in text, such as disease names, symptoms, medications, medical procedures, dosages, and laboratory results.¹
  * Relation Extraction (RE): Finds and classifies semantic relationships between identified entities (e.g., "drug X treats disease Y," "symptom Z is caused by condition A").
  * Text Classification: Categorizes medical documents or text segments into predefined classes (e.g., identifying medical report types, patient sentiment).
  * Summarization: Generates concise and relevant summaries of lengthy medical documents or complex patient histories.
  * Semantic Search: Enables searching for medical information based on meaning and context, not just keywords, within the medical record database.
  * Automated De-identification: Removes personally identifiable information (PII) from medical texts to protect patient privacy, crucial for PIPL compliance and the use of data for research.
* **NLP Innovation:**
  * **Development of Mandarin-Specific Medical Domain NLP Models:** This is a significant competitive advantage.

* **Specific Competitive Advantage for Hangzhou:** MediTrustAl's NLP capability to accurately process Mandarin-language medical records and integrate them with Chinese medical standards will be a strong differentiator, demonstrating the platform's readiness for the local market and overcoming challenges often faced by generic NLP solutions.

### **Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Predictive Analytics and Clinical Decision Support**

MediTrustAl's AI module leverages structured data generated by NLP and other data sources to provide predictive insights and intelligent decision support.

* **AI Models Used:**
  * Classic Machine Learning (ML): Algorithms like logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting will be used for tasks such as risk classification, event prediction, and risk factor analysis.¹
  * Deep Learning (DL): Artificial neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for medical image analysis (if relevant and integrated), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers for sequential data analysis (e.g., time-series data from sensors or disease progression history) and deeper contextual understanding of medical data.
* **AI Applications (with a focus on Hangzhou's needs):**
  * **Disease Risk Prediction:** Identifying high-risk patients for specific diseases prevalent in Hangzhou and Zhejiang, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases (e.g., congestive heart failure in the aging population), and sepsis in hospital environments. Specific example: "AI model for predicting the risk of diabetes complications (nephropathy, retinopathy) in elderly patients in Hangzhou based on data from ICHC and historical medical records processed by NLP."
  * **Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS):** Providing evidence-based recommendations to doctors regarding differential diagnoses, optimal treatment choices, drug interaction warnings, and the latest treatment protocols, tailored to the patient's clinical context.¹
  * **Personalization of Care:** Customizing treatment plans, drug dosages, or preventive interventions based on genetic profiles (if data is available and permitted), lifestyle, comorbidities, and individual patient responses to previous treatments.
  * **Cohort Analysis and Population Health:** Using aggregated and anonymous data to identify disease trends, the effectiveness of public health interventions, population-level risk factors, and health disparities in the Hangzhou region.¹
* **AI Innovation:**
  * **Development of Highly Accurate and Interpretable Predictive Models (Explainable AI - XAI):** Focus on creating AI models that are not only accurate but also transparent in their decision-making processes. This is important for building trust and facilitating adoption by clinicians in Hangzhou, who may require an understanding of why AI provides certain recommendations.
  * **Multi-modal Data Integration:** Ability to integrate and analyze various types of health data, including structured data, NLP-derived narrative data, medical imaging data (if developed), and data from wearable devices, for a more holistic patient view.
  * **Continuous Learning:** AI models will be designed to continuously learn and improve their performance as new data comes in, ensuring relevance and accuracy over time.
* **Specific Competitive Advantage for Hangzhou:** AI applications tailored to address specific health challenges in Hangzhou, such as managing chronic diseases in the large elderly population or predicting risks for conditions commonly encountered in local hospitals, will demonstrate direct relevance and impact.

### **Blockchain for Security, Privacy, Interoperability, and Governance**

Blockchain technology forms the backbone of trust and security in the MediTrustAl ecosystem.

* **Type of Blockchain Used:** Most likely a consortium blockchain or private permissioned blockchain, where authorized participants (e.g., hospitals, clinics, verified research institutions) have permission to participate in the network. This type is more suitable for sensitive health data than public blockchains.
* **Key Blockchain Features and Innovation:**
  * **Decentralized Identity Management (DID):** Each patient, service provider, and researcher will have a secure, portable, and verifiable digital identity that they control themselves.
  * **Patient-Centric Consent Management:** Patients grant explicit permission via smart contracts to determine who can access their health data, which parts of the data can be accessed, for what purpose, and for how long. This is a technical implementation of PIPL principles.¹²
  * **Immutable Hash Logging of Data:** Cryptographic hashes of each medical record or data transaction are recorded on the blockchain. The raw medical data itself is stored securely and encrypted off-chain, with a link to the hash on the blockchain. This ensures data integrity (proof that data has not been altered) without burdening the blockchain with large and sensitive data.
  * **Smart Contracts for Advanced Data Governance:** Automating data sharing agreements, research consent protocols (including potential for dynamic "meta-consent" models¹³), and PIPL compliance audits. This governance will explicitly detail how PIPL compliance is enforced, especially for "separate consent" and potential cross-border data transfers if required and permitted.¹²
  * **Blockchain-Facilitated Data Interoperability:** Although raw data is stored off-chain, the blockchain can act as a "notary layer" or "trusted index" that facilitates secure and standardized data exchange between different systems via APIs connected to the blockchain. This can help connect existing "data islands" in ICHC systems and other hospitals in Hangzhou, supporting existing regional data sharing initiatives.
  * **Audit Trails:** Every data access or transaction is recorded transparently and immutably on the blockchain, providing robust auditing capabilities for security and compliance.
  * **Efficient and Secure Consensus Mechanisms:** Selection of a consensus mechanism appropriate for a health data network, balancing efficiency, security, and scalability.
  * **Scalability Solutions:** Implementing solutions like sharding or layer-2 protocols if needed to ensure the platform can handle large transaction volumes as users and data grow.
* **Specific Competitive Advantage for Hangzhou:** MediTrustAl's blockchain capability to provide a secure, transparent, and PIPL-compliant platform for sharing and managing health data will be highly valuable in Hangzhou's rapidly developing and data regulation-aware digital ecosystem. This also supports Zhejiang's goal of improving health data interoperability.

Potential collaboration with local research institutions such as Zhejiang University¹⁸, Westlake University²⁵, or Zhejiang Lab¹⁵ can be explored for joint development, validation, or trial of these technology components, strengthening MediTrustAl's integration into Hangzhou's innovation ecosystem.
