## Suggested "Baby-Step To-Do List" for Next Step:

* **Current Focus:** Starting Module 0: Environment Setup & Basic Infrastructure.
* **Suggested Baby-Step:**
    1.  **Task:** Project Initialization & Version Control.
        * **Details:**
            * Create the main project folder named `MediTrustAl_Project` on your local machine.
            * Inside it, create a subfolder `src` (for source code) and copy the existing `memory-bank` folder (with its contents) into `MediTrustAl_Project`.
            * Open a terminal inside the `MediTrustAl_Project` folder.
            * Run `git init` to initialize a new Git repository.
            * Create a `.gitignore` file and add common entries for the language/frameworks to be used (e.g., `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `node_modules/`, `build/`, `dist/`, `.env`, etc.).
            * Create a new repository on GitHub (or your chosen platform) named `MediTrustAl`.
            * Follow GitHub's instructions to connect your local repository to the remote (usually involves `git remote add origin <YOUR_REMOTE_URL>`).
            * Make an initial commit: `git add .`, then `git commit -m "Initial project setup with Vibe Coding documents"`.
            * Push the initial commit to the remote: `git push -u origin main` (or `master` depending on your default configuration).
        * **Validation:**
            * Project folder correctly structured locally.
            * Git repository successfully initialized.
            * `.gitignore` file exists and contains relevant entries.
            * Remote repository successfully created and connected.
            * Initial commit visible on the remote repository.
