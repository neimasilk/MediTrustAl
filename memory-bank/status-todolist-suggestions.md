    * Frontend Security Enhancement - Comprehensive Token Management & API Security - ✅ COMPLETED.
* **Current Focus (Feature Freeze):**
    * Implementation of Frontend functionality based on completed M01-M11 mockups.
    * Preparation and execution of manual testing for Login (M01) and Registration (M02) flows.
    * Creation of `baby-step.md` documentation for frontend implementation guidance for junior developers.
    * Updating `petunjuk-manual-test.md` (manual test instructions) with complete instructions for frontend testing.

## Immediate Next Steps (Baby-Step To-Do List) - Initial Frontend Implementation Focus:

1.  **Frontend Implementation - Mockup-01 (Login Page):**
    * [ ] Create `LoginPage.jsx` component in `frontend/src/pages/`.
    * [ ] Implement UI based on `frontend/mockups/mockup-01-login.html`.
    * [ ] Connect with state management (Redux `authSlice`) to handle input, loading, and errors.
    * [ ] Integrate with `api.js` to call the `/auth/token` endpoint.
    * [ ] Handle success response (save token, navigate to dashboard) and errors (display messages).
    * [ ] Ensure there is a link to the registration page.
2.  **Frontend Implementation - Mockup-02 (Registration Page):**
    * [ ] Create `RegisterPage.jsx` component in `frontend/src/pages/`.
    * [ ] Implement UI based on `frontend/mockups/mockup-02-register.html`.
    * [ ] Connect with state management (Redux `authSlice`) to handle input, loading, and errors.
    * [ ] Integrate with `api.js` to call the `/auth/register` endpoint.
    * [ ] Handle success response (display message, navigate to login) and errors (display messages).
    * [ ] Ensure there is a link to the login page.
3.  **Initial Manual Testing (Login & Registration):**
    * [ ] Perform manual testing for login and registration flows according to `petunjuk-manual-test.md` (once updated).
    * [ ] Verify functionality, error handling, and token storage.
4.  **Implementation Support Documentation:**
    * [x] Create `baby-step.md` file in `memory-bank/` with detailed implementation steps for M01 & M02 (COMPLETED).
    * [ ] Update `petunjuk-manual-test.md` with complete instructions for manual frontend testing of M01 & M02.
    * [ ] Conduct a final review of all documents in `memory-bank/` and ensure consistency.
5.  **Backend & Testing:**
    * [x] All automated backend tests have passed successfully (PER USER INFO).
    * [ ] Consider adding E2E tests after M01 and M02 are stable.

## Technical Debt & Future Considerations (Status Unchanged, Priority After Current Phase):

1.  **Authentication & User Management:**
    * **[PENDING]** Refresh token mechanism.
    * **[PENDING]** Secure password reset flow.
2.  **Database:**
    * **[PENDING]** Further index optimization once query patterns are clearer.
    * **[PENDING]** Fine-tune database pooling for production.
    * **[PENDING]** Mature backup & restore strategy.
3.  **Blockchain:**
    * **[PENDING]** Gas optimization for smart contract functions.
    * **[PENDING]** More mature smart contract upgrade strategy.
    * **[PENDING]** Smart contract event monitoring system.
4.  **Testing:**
    * **[PENDING - PARTIALLY ADDRESSED]** Comprehensive manual testing for new features (Audit Log, UI Consent, DeepSeek Integration) added to `petunjuk-manual-test.md`. Manual test execution is still pending.
    * **[PENDING]** E2E (End-to-End) tests after the frontend is more functionally mature (post-mockup phase).
    * **[PENDING]** Performance testing (load testing) for APIs.
5.  **Documentation & Miscellaneous:**
    * **[MITIGATED FOR MVP]** Encryption Key Management: Current use of JWT secret for encryption key is an MVP approach. A better solution is needed post-MVP.
    * **[IMPROVED, BUT EXPANSION PENDING]** Logging has been added in `medical_records.py` (audit log) and `nlp_service.py`. Comprehensive structured logging is still PENDING.
    * **[POTENTIAL REFACTOR/CLARIFICATION]** Endpoint `/api/v1/users/register` vs `/api/v1/auth/register`. Current primary focus is on `/api/v1/auth/register`.
    * **[INFO/MINOR]** `Create Date` in Alembic migration file `a1b2e4306629_create_users_table.py` is still a placeholder.
    * **[PENDING]** Synchronize "Implementation Status" section in the main `README.md`.

## Next Meeting Agenda (Suggestions):

* **Review Frontend Mockups:** Go over the created `mockup-03-patient-dashboard.html` and discuss the next mockups.
* **Finalize Documentation Revisions:** Confirm the final changes to technical documentation.
* **Strategy for Fixing Failed Tests:** Allocate time and resources for fixing the remaining backend test failures.

*(Note: This file was last updated to reflect the completion of all backend tests and the shift to frontend implementation of M01 & M02.)*
