# Project Status, To-Do List, and Suggestions: MediTrustAl

## Current Project Status:
* **Project Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Backend Setup & Blockchain Foundation (MVP Focus)
* **Description:** Step 1.3 sedang dalam proses implementasi. Database PostgreSQL telah dikonfigurasi dan model User telah dibuat dengan integrasi autentikasi JWT. Migrasi database telah disiapkan menggunakan Alembic.
* **Last Completed Step:** Step 1.2: Basic Blockchain Network Setup (Local Development)
* **Current Step:** Step 1.3: User Identity and Basic Authentication (Application Layer)

## Progress Update (2024-03-15):
1. **Database Setup** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - [x] PostgreSQL 15.x installation and configuration
   - [x] Database model creation (User model with UUID)
   - [x] Alembic migration setup (version: 1.13.1)
   - [x] Database connection configuration with pgcrypto extension

2. **Authentication System** üîÑ IN PROGRESS
   - [x] JWT token implementation (python-jose)
   - [x] Password hashing with bcrypt (work factor: 12)
   - [x] User registration schema with Pydantic
   - [~] Login endpoint (70% complete)
   - [ ] Protected route middleware

3. **Blockchain Integration** ‚è≥ PENDING
   - [x] Ganache setup with deterministic addresses
   - [x] Basic smart contract deployment
   - [ ] DID generation and registration
   - [ ] Blockchain service integration

4. **Documentation** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - [x] Updated README.md with setup instructions
   - [x] Added troubleshooting guide
   - [x] Added testing documentation
   - [x] Updated project status
   - [x] Added development environment notes

## Immediate Next Steps (Prioritized):

1. **Complete Authentication System (High Priority):**
   * Complete login endpoint implementation
   * Implement JWT validation middleware
   * Add role-based access control (RBAC)
   * Test authentication flow end-to-end

2. **Blockchain Integration (High Priority):**
   * Complete DID generation service
   * Implement blockchain transaction service
   * Add transaction monitoring
   * Setup retry mechanism for failed transactions

3. **Testing Implementation (Medium Priority):**
   * Write unit tests for auth services
   * Add integration tests for database
   * Setup CI pipeline with GitHub Actions
   * Add contract tests for blockchain

4. **Security Enhancements (Medium Priority):**
   * Implement rate limiting
   * Add request validation
   * Setup error logging
   * Configure security headers

## Technical Debt & Issues:

1. **Authentication:**
   * Need to implement refresh token mechanism
   * Password reset flow not designed yet
   * Session management to be implemented
   * 2FA consideration for future

2. **Database:**
   * Need to optimize indexes
   * Add database pooling
   * Setup backup strategy
   * Add monitoring queries

3. **Blockchain:**
   * Gas optimization needed
   * Backup node setup pending
   * Contract upgrade strategy needed
   * Event monitoring system needed

4. **Testing:**
   * E2E tests missing
   * Performance tests needed
   * Security testing framework needed
   * Load testing plan required

## Next Meeting Agenda:

1. Review authentication system progress
2. Discuss blockchain integration challenges
3. Plan testing strategy implementation
4. Set priorities for security enhancements
