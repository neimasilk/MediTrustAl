# Implementation Progress Report: MediTrustAl

This document tracks the completed baby-steps during the development of the MediTrustAl project.

---

**Date:** (Assumed Recently Completed)
**Baby Step Completed:** Phase 3, Step 3.1 - NLP Service (Placeholder)
**Summary:**
*   Implemented Placeholder NLP Service (`nlp_service.py`).
*   Implemented API Endpoint `POST /api/v1/nlp/extract-entities` (in `src/app/api/endpoints/nlp.py`).
*   Added Pydantic models for NLP request/response (`NLPExtractionRequest`, `NLPEntity`, `NLPExtractionResponse` in `src/app/api/endpoints/nlp.py`).
*   Registered NLP router in `main.py`.
*   Unit tests for `nlp_service.py` created and passing.
*   Integration tests for API endpoint NLP created and passing.
*   OpenAPI documentation (Swagger) for the NLP endpoint is available and reflects its placeholder nature.
**Additional Notes:** This completes Step 3.1 of the Implementation Plan, providing a placeholder for future NLP integration (e.g., DeepSeek API).

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Baby Step Completed:** Module 0 - Project Initialization & Version Control
**Summary:**
* Project folder structure (`src`, `memory-bank`, etc., in repository root) has been created.
* Local Git repository has been initialized within the repository root.
* `.gitignore` file has been created in the repository root and configured with standard entries.
* Remote repository (`MediTrustAl`) has been created on GitHub (if not cloned).
* Local repository (repository root) has been successfully connected to the remote repository.
* Initial commit containing planning documents from `memory-bank` (located in repository root) has been pushed to remote.

**Baby Step Completed:** Phase 4, Step 4.1 - Simplified Consent Logic in Smart Contract and Backend
**Summary:**
*   Modified `MedicalRecordRegistry.sol` smart contract to include `recordAccessList` mapping, `grantAccess`, `revokeAccess`, and `checkAccess` functions with associated events and error handling. Unit tests for these changes were added and passed.
*   Updated `BlockchainService` in `src/app/core/blockchain.py` with `grant_record_access`, `revoke_record_access`, and `check_record_access` methods, along with corresponding unit tests.
*   Implemented new API endpoints in `src/app/api/endpoints/medical_records.py`:
    *   `POST /medical-records/{record_id}/grant-access`
    *   `POST /medical-records/{record_id}/revoke-access`
    *   `GET /medical-records/{record_id}/check-access/{accessor_address}` (helper endpoint)
*   Defined `GrantAccessRequest` Pydantic model with validation.
*   Modified `GET /medical-records/{record_id}` API endpoint to include access control checks for doctors based on blockchain permissions.
*   Added comprehensive integration tests for all new and modified API endpoints.
*   Added deployment instructions for the smart contract to `memory-bank/petunjuk-manual-test.md`.
**Additional Notes:** User will handle manual deployment of the smart contract to their local Ganache. One integration test (`test_get_medical_record_detail_doctor_record_no_data_hash`) has a minor discrepancy in the expected error message detail, though the HTTP status code is correct.
