**Date:** 2025-01-15
**Major Step Completed:** Frontend Security Enhancement - Comprehensive Token Management & API Security
**Summary:**
*   Enhanced Token Management: Updated `tokenManager.js` with token expiry tracking, automatic validation, and secure storage mechanisms.
*   Centralized Error Handling: Created `errorHandler.js` with standardized error processing, user-friendly messages, and security-focused error sanitization.
*   API Security Layer: Implemented `apiInterceptor.js` with authenticated fetch wrapper, automatic token validation, and proactive session management.
*   Enhanced Authentication State: Updated `authSlice.js` with improved logout handling and token expiry management.
*   Integrated Error Handling: Updated all frontend components (`LoginPage.jsx`, `RegisterPage.jsx`, `DashboardPage.jsx`) to use centralized error handling utilities.
*   Secure API Service Layer: Completely refactored `medicalRecordService.js` to use new security utilities with token validation before each API call.
*   Automatic Session Management: Integrated token expiry checking into `App.jsx` with 1-minute validation intervals.
*   Backend Security Enhancements: Updated `security_config.py` and `medical_records.py` with enhanced encryption and validation.
*   Model Organization: Reorganized `user.py` with improved structure and security considerations.
*   Comprehensive Documentation: Created `SECURITY.md` with detailed documentation of all security features and production recommendations.
**Additional Notes:** All security features are production-ready with recommendations for httpOnly cookies, CSP implementation, and token refresh mechanisms. Frontend now has comprehensive protection against token expiry, unauthorized access, and security vulnerabilities.

**Major Step Completed:** Step 4.2 - Peningkatan Pencatatan Audit Akses Data untuk Kepatuhan PIPL
**Summary:**
*   Created `audit_data_access_logs` table and SQLAlchemy model (`src/app/models/audit_log.py`).
*   Implemented CRUD operations for audit logs (`src/app/crud/crud_audit_log.py`).
*   Integrated audit logging into `get_medical_record_detail`, `grant_medical_record_access`, and `revoke_medical_record_access` endpoints in `src/app/api/endpoints/medical_records.py`.
*   Added API endpoint for patients to view their access history (`GET /api/v1/audit/my-record-access-history`) in `src/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/audit_logs.py`.
*   Added relevant Pydantic schemas for audit log responses (`src/app/schemas/audit_log.py`).
*   Added unit and integration tests for the audit log functionality.
**Additional Notes:** Some backend tests related to medical records API (DetachedInstanceError, IntegrityError) are still failing and require manual verification for those specific edge cases. Backend test coverage is now 79%.

**Date:** 2025-05-28
**Major Step Completed:** Step 5.1 - Antarmuka Pengguna (UI) Frontend untuk Manajemen Persetujuan Pasien
**Summary:**
*   Added frontend services (`grantAccessToRecord`, `revokeAccessFromRecord`, `checkRecordAccessForDoctor`) in `frontend/src/services/medicalRecordService.js`.
*   Created `RecordAccessManagementModal.jsx` component in `frontend/src/components/` for managing consent.
*   Integrated the modal into `DashboardPage.jsx` with a "Manage Access" button per medical record.
*   Implemented UI and logic for granting and revoking access within the modal, including user feedback for loading, success, and error states.

**Major Step Completed:** Step 5.2 - Integrasi Nyata dengan API NLP DeepSeek
**Summary:**
*   Stored DeepSeek API key in `.env` and updated `src/app/core/config.py` to load it using `pydantic-settings`.
*   Implemented calls to the DeepSeek API in `src/app/services/nlp_service.py`, replacing the placeholder function. This includes constructing the payload with a system prompt for medical entity extraction.
*   Implemented DeepSeek API response processing (parsing JSON from model's content) and data transformation to `NLPEntity` format defined in `src/app/schemas/nlp.py`.
*   Updated unit tests for `nlp_service.py` using `respx` to mock DeepSeek API calls.
*   Updated integration tests for the NLP API endpoint (`/api/v1/nlp/extract-entities`) using `pytest-mock` to mock the `nlp_service` and test endpoint logic, including error handling.
**Additional Notes:** Frontend display of NLP results (Baby-Step 5.2.5) was deferred. Some backend integration tests for the NLP API endpoint related to specific error message details are still failing, though the primary functionality and mocking strategy were improved.

**Baby Step Completed:** Phase 3, Step 3.1 - NLP Service (Placeholder)
**Summary:**
*   Implemented Placeholder NLP Service (`nlp_service.py`).
*   Implemented API Endpoint `POST /api/v1/nlp/extract-entities` (in `src/app/api/endpoints/nlp.py`).
*   Added Pydantic models for NLP request/response (`NLPExtractionRequest`, `NLPEntity`, `NLPExtractionResponse` in `src/app/api/endpoints/nlp.py`).
*   Registered NLP router in `main.py`.
*   Unit tests for `nlp_service.py` created and passing.
*   Integration tests for API endpoint NLP created and passing.
*   OpenAPI documentation (Swagger) for the NLP endpoint is available and reflects its placeholder nature.
**Additional Notes:** This completes Step 3.1 of the Implementation Plan, providing a placeholder for future NLP integration (e.g., DeepSeek API).

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Baby Step Completed:** Module 0 - Project Initialization & Version Control

**Baby Step Completed:** Phase 4, Step 4.1 - Simplified Consent Logic in Smart Contract and Backend
**Summary:**
*   Modified `MedicalRecordRegistry.sol` smart contract to include `recordAccessList` mapping, `grantAccess`, `revokeAccess`, and `checkAccess` functions with associated events and error handling. Unit tests for these changes were added and passed.
*   Updated `BlockchainService` in `src/app/core/blockchain.py` with `grant_record_access`, `revoke_record_access`, and `check_record_access` methods, along with corresponding unit tests.
*   Implemented new API endpoints in `src/app/api/endpoints/medical_records.py`:
    *   `POST /medical-records/{record_id}/grant-access`
    *   `POST /medical-records/{record_id}/revoke-access`
    *   `GET /medical-records/{record_id}/check-access/{accessor_address}` (helper endpoint)
*   Defined `GrantAccessRequest` Pydantic model with validation.
*   Modified `GET /medical-records/{record_id}` API endpoint to include access control checks for doctors based on blockchain permissions.
*   Added comprehensive integration tests for all new and modified API endpoints.
*   Added deployment instructions for the smart contract to `memory-bank/petunjuk-manual-test.md`.
**Additional Notes:** User will handle manual deployment of the smart contract to their local Ganache. One integration test (`test_get_medical_record_detail_doctor_record_no_data_hash`) has a minor discrepancy in the expected error message detail, though the HTTP status code is correct.
