The main objectives of MediTrustAl are:

* **Improve the Quality of Healthcare Services:** Provide more accurate diagnoses, more personalized and proactive treatments, and reduce medical errors.  
* **Enhance Operational Efficiency:** Optimize workflows for healthcare providers through automation and better data access.  
* **Empower Patients:** Give patients full control over their health data, increasing privacy and trust.  
* **Accelerate Medical Research:** Provide secure access to high-quality anonymized data for research and innovation.  
* **Ensure Data Security and Privacy:** Utilize blockchain technology to ensure integrity, security, and compliance with data regulations (such as PIPL in China).  
* **Support Hangzhou's Strategic Priorities:** Contribute to Hangzhou's ambition to become a leader in AI innovation, healthcare/biomedical services, and the digital economy.

## **3\. Target Users**

The MediTrustAl platform will serve various stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem:

1. **Patients:**  
   * Individuals seeking greater control over their health data.  
   * Patients with chronic conditions requiring proactive monitoring and care.  
   * The elderly population requiring coordinated health management.  
2. **Doctors and Healthcare Providers:**  
   * Doctors in hospitals, clinics, and Integrated County Healthcare Consortia (ICHC).  
   * Medical professionals needing access to comprehensive patient medical histories and clinical decision support tools.  
3. **Medical Researchers:**  
   * Researchers at universities, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies needing access to anonymized medical data for studies and development.  
4. **Hospitals and Healthcare Institutions:**  
   * Healthcare providers looking to improve operational efficiency, quality of care, and data interoperability.  
5. **System Administrators:**  
   * IT personnel responsible for platform management, security, and compliance.

## **4\. Key Features and Functionality**

MediTrustAl will include several core functional layers:

### **4.1. Data Layer (Blockchain)**

* **Decentralized Identity Management (DID):** Secure and verifiable digital identities for all users.  
* **Medical Record Data Hash Logging:** Storing cryptographic hashes of medical records on the blockchain for integrity and immutability. Raw data is stored securely off-chain.  
* **Smart Contracts for Access Permissions and Governance:**  
  * Patients control access permissions to their data (who, what, when, why).  
  * Automate data-sharing agreements and research protocols.  
  * Ensure PIPL compliance.  
* **Audit Trails:** Transparent logging of all data access and transactions.

### **4.2. Processing and Analytics Layer (NLP & AI)**

* **NLP (Natural Language Processing) Module:**  
  * Information extraction from narrative medical data (doctor's notes, pathology reports) in Mandarin.  
  * Standardization of medical terminology (mapping to ontologies like SNOMED CT, ICD, CDMO).  
  * Automatic data de-identification for privacy.  
  * Automatic generation of clinical summaries.  
* **AI (Artificial Intelligence) Module:**  
  * Predictive analytics for disease risk and prognosis.  
  * Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for doctors.  
  * Personalization of treatment plans and lifestyle recommendations.  
  * Cohort analysis and population health using anonymized aggregate data.

### **4.3. Application/Interface Layer**

* **Patient Portal:**  
  * Manage personal health data.  
  * View medical history.  
  * Set access permissions.  
  * Interact with service providers.  
* **Doctor/Clinician Portal:**  
  * Access patient data (with permission).  
  * Use CDSS and AI analytics tools.  
  * Collaborate with other specialists.  
* **Researcher Portal:**  
  * Request access to anonymized data.  
  * Manage research projects.  
  * Access data analysis tools (with strict governance).  
* **System Administrator Portal:**  
  * Manage platform operations, security, and compliance.

### **4.4. Specific Flagship Functionalities (Example for Hangzhou)**

* **Proactive Management of Chronic Diseases in the Elderly at ICHC:** Wearable data integration, prediction of complication risks, early warnings for doctors.  
* **Optimization of Sepsis Diagnosis and Treatment in Referral Hospitals:** Real-time data integration, AI-powered sepsis risk monitoring, evidence-based treatment protocol recommendations.

## **5\. Initial Technical Considerations**

* **Blockchain:** Likely a consortium or private permissioned blockchain.  
* **Data Storage:** Raw medical data stored off-chain (hospital servers/secure cloud), encrypted links to hashes on the blockchain.  
* **NLP:** Development or fine-tuning of large language models for the Mandarin medical domain, integration with local and international medical ontologies.  
* **AI:** Use of classic Machine Learning and Deep Learning, focus on Explainable AI (XAI).  
* **Interoperability:** Support for standards like HL7 FHIR.  
* **Security & Privacy:** Design that inherently supports PIPL compliance.

## **6\. Success Metrics (Expected Impact)**

* **For Patients:** Increased control over data, more personalized care, reduction in medical errors.  
* **For Doctors & Providers:** Comprehensive data access, intelligent decision support tools, reduced administrative burden, increased efficiency.  
* **For Medical Researchers:** Access to larger, high-quality datasets, acceleration of research cycles.  
* **For the Healthcare System:** Improved overall service quality, cost reduction through efficiency and prevention, improved public health.  
* **For Hangzhou:** Creation of high-quality jobs, attraction of investment, enhanced reputation as a center for health innovation.

## **7\. Long-Term Vision**

MediTrustAl aims to evolve into a broader healthcare ecosystem platform, integrated with various public health initiatives and other new technologies in Hangzhou, making it a reference model for smart healthcare at national and international levels.
